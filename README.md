# Python-Utilities
A simple set of utilities for python, in development

the entire piece of software runs in the terminal and has a couple of apps, Slime fighter (a basic game), painted cube solver (to solve the painted cube problem once and for all), time (10 second sample of the date and time), dictionary (A dictionary, but definitions have been AI generated so may not be entirely accurate), a basic 4 operation 2-number calculator for when you're desperate and triangle area finder (to find the area of a triangle)
